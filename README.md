# preonic-ergo
Ergonomic Keymap for the Preonic 50% keyboard

Based loosely off the [Raise Ergo](https://github.com/marlonrichert/raise-ergo) layout with some inspiration taken from the [orthodeluxe](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/planck/keymaps/orthodeluxe) and [cb1](https://github.com/cleaver/qmk_firmware/tree/3f92b4475218cd18fbea1fc6d603ffd9825f81ba/keyboards/preonic/keymaps/cb1) layouts.
